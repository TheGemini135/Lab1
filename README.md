Designed a simulation of a 6-bit current scaling DAC while determining the estimation of its INL and DNL. The model.readme cell in library a2dlib was saved into the directory as models.m. This is the device model file used in the simulation. The schematic of dac_6bit_tb cell in library a2dlib was opened and a transient simulation was performed as indicated in the readme cell view. The model file was set up and ran for transient simulation for testing purposes. The DAC Vref is 1V and its output has a constant DC offset of 1V since the OPA used in the design does have rail-to-rail output. Thus, the DAC output changes from 1V to 2-1/2 6V when the DAC input changes from 0 to 63. A test bench circuit was created and the cell write_analog_value of a2dlib was implemented in order to write the DAC output into Matlab file "anaData.m". The properties of the write_analog_value was modified to record the correct number of data points and capture the DAC output at the proper time. Another simulation was performed to obtain the data file anaData.m, which is located in the root directory within the GPDK90.oa file within the Linux terminal home library.
